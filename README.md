# StackDesign (C#/.NET 8)

A C# educational repository focused on learning and demonstrating object-oriented programming concepts, especially inheritance, using a dynamic stack implementation. Built with .NET 8 and C# 12, this project provides a simple stack class with core operations and is designed for hands-on exploration of class design and extension.

### Features
•	Dynamic stack with automatic resizing

•	Core stack operations: Push, Pop, Peek, and Clear

•	Exception handling for stack underflow

•	Structured for easy extension and inheritance


### Educational Purpose
This repository is intended for students and developers who want to understand how inheritance works in C#. The Stacks class can be extended to add new behaviors or override existing ones, making it a practical starting point for experimenting with class hierarchies.
